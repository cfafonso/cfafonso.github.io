Hi, my name is Claudia Afonso. I'm a data scientist with expertise in programming, data wrangling, machine learning, and statistical analysis of large datasets. My background also includes chemistry and biomedical research, with hands-on experience in chemical and molecular biology techniques. I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my technical and analytical skills to solve real-world problems in data-driven industries. My GitHub portfolio showcases projects where Iâ€™ve applied programming and machine learning techniques to solve problems in various contexts.

While living in Portugal at the moment, I'm available for immediate relocation or remote work. I have experience living and working abroad, first in Germany as a research intern through the IAESTE program, and later in Cambridge, United Kingdom, as a visiting doctoral student. I'm fluent in written and spoken English, and I understand German at an intermediate level.
