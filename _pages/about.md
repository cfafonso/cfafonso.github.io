Hi, my name is Claudia Afonso. I'm a chemical biologist and data scientist with a strong research background. I have specialized in developing chemical biology strategies for the modification of proteins, as well as in applying machine learning and statistical analysis to complex datasets.

What excites me most is solving problems that require domain knowledge and computational thinking. I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can apply this hybrid skill set, whether that's in pharmaceutical research and development, cheminformatics, biotech data analysis, or broader data science applications in healthcare and life sciences. My GitHub portfolio showcases projects where I've applied programming and machine learning to solve problems in various contexts.

While I am living in Lisbon at the moment, I am fully prepared to relocate. I have experience living and working abroad, first in Germany as a research intern of the IAESTE program, and later in Cambridge, United Kingdom as a visiting doctoral student. I am fluent in written and spoken English, and I also understand German at an intermediate level.
