Hi there, my name is Claudia Afonso. I'm a biomedical researcher and data scientist, specialized in developing chemical biology strategies for the modification of proteins, as well as in applying machine learning and statistical analysis to complex datasets. I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my hybrid skill set to solve real-world problems, whether that’s in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, or technology sectors. My GitHub portfolio showcases projects where I’ve applied programming and machine learning techniques to solve problems in various contexts.

While living in Lisbon at the moment, I'm fully prepared to relocate. I have experience living and working abroad, first in Germany as a research intern of the IAESTE program, and later in Cambridge, United Kingdom as a visiting doctoral student. I am fluent in written and spoken English, and I also understand German at an intermediate level.
